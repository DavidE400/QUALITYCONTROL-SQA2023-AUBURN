1. Activity 4.a. - A pre-hook was created to run bandit on all python files in the repository in an effort to detect vulnerabilities. 
To use the git hook copy and paste the pre-commit file into .git/hooks after partitioning the pre-commit.git file into pre-commit. 
Also please modify any file in the repository to trigger the commit and it should output vulnerabilities.csv to report weaknesses. 
Note: unlike the workshop we use bandit instead of cppcheck. Below is a screenshot of the output generated by the vulnerabilities.csv file. 
B105 seems to be the only and most prevalent security weakness found in the repository.

2. Activity 4.b. - Auto Github Actions is done. fuzz.py will autorun when push. fuzz.py method is found within the root KubeSec-master.

3. Activity 4.c. - 

4. Discussion -
