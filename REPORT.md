# QUALITYCONTROL PROJECT REPORT #

## Activities: ##
* 4.a. - A pre-hook was created to run bandit on all python files in the repository in an effort to detect vulnerabilities. 
To use the git hook copy and paste the pre-commit file into .git/hooks after partitioning the pre-commit.git file into pre-commit. 
Also please modify any file in the repository to trigger the commit and it should output vulnerabilities.csv to report weaknesses. 
Note: unlike the workshop we use bandit instead of cppcheck. Below is a screenshot of the output generated by the vulnerabilities.csv file. 
B105 seems to be the only and most prevalent security weakness found in the repository.

* 4.b. - Auto Github Actions is done. fuzz.py will autorun when push. fuzz.py method is found within the root KubeSec-master.

* 4.c. - Logging was integrated into several methods within parser.py, graphtaint.py, and main.py. The time, date, and result of the methods' execution are formatted and logged into a separate file called "KubeSec-LOGGER.log". Logging can be useful for digital investigations because it leaves a trace of exactly what happened and at what time. This activity showed how simple, yet effective logging can be.

### Lessons Learned: ###
The main lesson learned in this project is to always integrate Software Quality Assurance tools to prevent vulnerabilities. Either by using hooks to implement security tools like bandit, to using white box fuzzing, and or integrating forensics to truly assure quality in software.
